# A stem-like fate maintenance circuit drives a homology class during the embryonic development of *C. elegans*

## *C. elegans*, a model organism of developmental biology

The worm *C. elegans* is a fantastic model organism for developmental biology for many reasons. 
It is transparent, and hence it is amenable to study using the microscope. This property allowed Sulston and Horvitz to 
completely map its embryogenesis cell-by-cell. Later on, they expanded this study to look at the division pattern post-embryogenesis. The remarkable thing from the cell lineage of *C. elegans* is that it 
is invariant: all worms will have exactly the same number of cells, and division pattern.
