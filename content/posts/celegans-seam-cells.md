## *C. elegans*, a model organism of developmental biology

The worm *Caenorhabditis elegans* is a fantastic model organism for developmental biology for many reasons. 
It is transparent, and hence it is amenable to study using the microscope. This property allowed Sulston and Horvitz to 
completely map its embryogenesis cell-by-cell. Later on, they expanded this study to look at the division pattern post-embryogenesis. The remarkable thing from the cell lineage of *C. elegans* is that it is invariant: all individuals from this species will have an identical division pattern.
This property of cell invariance is known as [eutely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutely).

Each terminal branch of the embryonic lineage is lahelled either with X (indicating cell death; the position of the X on the time axis indicates the time of maximum refractility) or with a lineage name followed by a functional name."
