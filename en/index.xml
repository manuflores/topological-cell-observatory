      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;census-of-developmental-cell-manifolds&#34;&gt;Census of developmental cell manifolds&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We define cell state manifolds as a simplicial complex filtration from a sc point cloud. Given the biological processes they represent, cell state manifolds have remarkable structure. However, we lack systematic approach to study this structure or shape/form.  Despite a priori, shapes and forms may sound as something difficult to define precisely,  in 1895 Poincar√© developed the foundations of a new mathematical field, algebraic topology, that focuses on quantifying shape via the computation of invariants, that is, properties that remain unchanged after perturbation / deformation. In other words, topological invariants are numbers that encapsulate key properties of shapes. In more recent years, there has been a significant advance computational topology. In this study we leverage concepts from topology to systematically quantify the global structure of cell state manifolds across the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
